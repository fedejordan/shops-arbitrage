## üñ•Ô∏è How to use the platform

### 1. Frontend (Website)
- The website is where you search and compare products.
- **How to access:**
  - If the site is deployed, just visit the provided link (ask the project owner for the URL).
  - If you want to run it locally:
    1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if you don‚Äôt have it).
    2. Open a terminal, go to the `frontend` folder, and run:
       ```bash
       npm install
       npm run dev
       ```
    3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 2. Backend (API)
- The backend powers the website and handles all the data.
- **How to start:**
    1. Make sure you have [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/) installed.
    2. Open a terminal, go to the `backend` folder, and run:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       uvicorn main:app --reload
       ```
    3. The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 3. Database
- All product and price data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **How to set up:**
    1. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
    2. Create a database (e.g. `shops_arbitrage`).
    3. Run the SQL scripts in the `db/` folder to create the tables:
       - `schema.sql` (main structure)
       - Other `.sql` files for updates and extra features
    4. Make sure the backend can connect to your database. You may need to set an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL` (ask the project owner for details).

### 4. Scrapers (Getting the data)
- Scrapers collect product and price data from different stores.
- **How to run all scrapers:**
    1. Go to the `scrapers` folder in a terminal.
    2. Run:
       ```bash
       bash run-all-scrapers.sh
       ```
    3. This will update the database with the latest products and prices.
